-This app is packaged with node and the required modules

Steps to start the app

1) install nodeJS
2) go to the directory via command line, start node with myHttpServer.js
3) go to localhost:8080
4) This will only work for localhost as i had to register the callback url with soundcloud as a part getting authorization from soundcloud to use their api

My client id for reference is 398d032e2eef22230f666f001b8ba297 which is hardcoded to the application
